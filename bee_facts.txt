It has been 4 hours since I successfully sucked my own penis. Things are different now. As soon as mouth-to-penis contact was made I felt a shockwave through my body. I have reason to believe I have super strength and telekinesis now.. 3 hours after contact I noticed a van parked on my street but no one has entered or exited the car since its arrival. I fear for my safety, I'm not sure what sort of power I may have stumbled upon but it's possible that the government has found out. If I don't update this again please send help

If you were in the bathroom and encountered a bee, you may panic, and the ensuing chaos may cause you to trip.

Queen Bees have it easy, and don't have to worry.

Worker bees are born to be busy, not sit around all day like the lazy Queens.
Worker bees will never become the Queen Bee because those are two different bee jobs.
